The government then assured the people&#8217;s representatives that no survey would be undertaken without the cooperation of the local people. But during a recent visit, the Chief Secretary had reportedly instructed the authorities concerned to explore the possibilities of a road in the region, they said.</p><p class="body">Showing copies of documents from the National Transportation Planning And Research Centre (NATPAC) and the Kerala Road Fund Board (KRFB) validating their claims, they said the government decision earlier was to develop seven roads as per a project report on the airport in 2009. The work included the widening of the Mele Chovva - Mattanur road, which has a width of 19 m. The survey work was entrusted to NATPAC, which estimated the cost of widening the road at Rs.230 crore, and the report on this was submitted to the KRFB in 2009 itself.</p><p class="body">The NATPAC report was concealed and a new survey was conducted during the previous Left Democratic Front reign, they said.</p><p class="body">A private agency, which was assigned the survey work, came up with a bloated estimate of Rs.1,000 crore for the road widening work and also suggested a new 20-km road from Edachovva to the airport (Moorkhanparambu) at a cost of Rs.500 crore.</p><p class="body">Any move to resume the survey for the new road would be resisted, the action committee members said.</p><p class="body"><i><b><hr/><li><p class="body">&#8216;NATPAC had estimated road widening cost at Rs.230 crore in 2009&#8217;</p></li><li><p class="body">&#8216;But a private agency gave a bloated estimate of Rs.1,000 crore during LDF rule&#8217;</p></li></b></i></p><hr/><

The road links the service road under Vyttila Railway Overbridge to the Mobility Hub.</p><p class="body">A large number of women, representatives of organisations, including residents&#8217; associations, laid siege to the Vyttila Mobility Hub end of the road under the banner of Vyttila RSAC Road Janakeeya Samithi.</p><p class="body">The main demand was the reconstruction of the road. The road had been resurfaced twice in the past two months, but still the road is in a pitiable condition.</p><p class="body">CPI(M) Vyttila area secretary N. Satheesh inaugurated the demonstration. He said RSAC Road was the main link for road users and motorists coming from Irumpanam, Thiruvankulam, Tripunithura and Eroor.</p><p class="body">It was also a crucial link for those heading to various parts of the city from the mobility hub. The Public Works Department had to take extra interest to repair the road at the earliest, he said. Traffic flow through the road had increased considerably after the mobility hub started functioning.</p><p class="body">Babu, a resident of the locality, said the road had been in poor condition even before the rains. &#8220;It worsened over the past two months, though it was repaired twice,&#8221; he said. The poor upkeep of the road has drawn the ire of the people because it is a crucial link to the busy mobility hub.</p><p class="body">Autorickshaw driver Kumar, who uses the road frequently to ferry passengers to the Mobility Hub, said the RSAC road had become difficult to negotiate.

The road needed to be completely resurfaced and construction material has already been procured for the purpose, said Ms. Dixon.</p><p class="body">She said one of the reasons for the poor condition of the road was constant waterlogging during the rains. The problem was severe during the monsoon months starting in June. Once the waterlogging issue was resolved, the road could be restored to normal traffic.</p><p class="body">She said the road did not have storm water drainage for the past two decades. New drains were being built, but work was often interrupted owing to intermittent rain.

Immediately, a strong police contingent from Tiruvallur rushed to the spot and conducted talks with residents, convincing them to disperse peacefully. An hour later, officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) also came to the spot and told the residents that efforts would be taken to ensure that tenders are floated and accepted by prospective contractors as soon as possible and that work would begin in a month. &#8220;We have again called for a tender for the project on October 23,&#8221; said an official of NHAI.</p><p class="body">After repeated petitions by residents and councillors from the neighbourhood, the district administration sought funds from the Centre a few years ago and a sum of Rs. 90.21 lakh was allotted under the Bharat Nirman scheme for 2012-2013.

The PWD is yetto launch roadworks though the rain has taken a break.— Photo: Vipin Chandran</div></div><div class="article-body"><p class="body">It has been more than a month since the deadline set for the Public Works Department (PWD) to begin roadworks lapsed. Yet, most roads maintained by the agency in the city and its suburbs are still in a state of disrepair.</p><p class="body">It was in mid-August this year that a slew of protests led PWD Minister V.K. Ebrahim Kunju to set September 10 as the deadline for repairing pothole-ridden roads.</p><p class="body">Major roads in the city were in a state of dilapidation owing to the PWD&#8217;s failure to resurface them before the monsoon. Numerous crucial roads suffered extensive damage in the rains. Matters were made worse by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA), which had dug up roads in the second half of May to lay pipelines.</p><p class="body"><b>Contractors blamed</b></p><p class="body">Today, the city&#8217;s prime Park Avenue Road that stretches from Broadway to Rajendra Maidan, is among the worst maintained roads. PWD officials said the contract to resurface the road was awarded to M.S. Abraham, months before the onset of rains.</p><p class="body">&#8220;He did practically nothing before and during the summer months. It was at the eleventh hour, the last week of May, that pothole filling began. Within days, rains began and work was abandoned. The last-minute roadworks worsened Park Avenue Road&#8217;s condition and potholes became wider, deeper.&#8221;</p><p class="body">Hundreds of commuters who regularly used the road were inconvenienced. Contractor Aji Abraham had deployed workers to resurface Palarivattom-Kakkanad Road late in May, but work was postponed once the rains arrived.</p><p class="body">Though a few potholes were filled in September, motorists continue to endure a gruelling ride through the stretch that leads from the city to Collectorate, Infopark, CEPZ, etc.</p><p class="body">On Alinchuvadu-Vennala Road, which runs parallel to NH Bypass, motorists have to endure a back-breaking ride. Contractor K.K. Shamsu resurfaced it in May, but the fresh coat was washed away in the rain. He is yet to launch roadworks, though the rain has taken a break. Even Edappally-Pookattuppady Road is in a shambles.</p><p class="body">There is a strong demand from residents&#8217; associations, merchants&#8217; organisations, private bus owners&#8217; associations and NGOs to blacklist contractors who have failed to resurface roads. However, higher-ups in the PWD have failed to take action.</p><p class="body">The agency&#8217;s Ernakulam executive engineer P. P. Benny said laying bituminous macadam on Civil Line Road that leads to Kakkanad would soon be completed. He blamed intermittent rain for the delay in resurfacing work.</p><p class="body">However, complaints are rife that contractors failed to mobilise their workforce and tar coat damaged portions when it did not rain in September.</p><p class="body">Mr. Benny blamed the KWA for its indifference in restoring dug-up roads in Fort Kochi, Tripunithura and Vypeen. &#8220;Roadworks in Vypeen will begin soon. GIDA has handed over Rs.3 crore. The total cost is Rs.12 crore.&#8221;</p><p class="body">Another PWD official said full-fledged resurfacing work might begin only in November.</p><p class="body">&#8220;A few contractors are ill-equipped, inefficient and not serious about their work. They must be blacklisted. Most of them do not have their own workforce and depend on sub-contractors. This causes delay.&#8221;</p><p class="body">Sources said approach roads to Edappally bridge could be resurfaced by the PWD-NH wing only if the government gave administrative sanction this month for the Rs.2 crore-work.Stir called off</p><p class="body">The PWD&#8217;s failure to repair the broken Chitoor-Cheranaloor Road prompted private bus workers&#8217; unions to call for strike from Thursday. However, the unions have put their plans on hold after District Collector Sheikh Pareeth and Hibi Eden, MLA, assured them that the stretch would be repaired in two weeks. &#8220;The PWD has not begun repairs despite the KWA handing over Rs.50 lakh,&#8221; said Joy Joseph of the AITUC.</p><p class="body">Meanwhile, bus workers in Tripunithura have called for a strike from October 21 over the PWD&#8217;s ineptitude in repairing damaged roads in Tiruvankulam.</p><

Some motorists refuse to comply with rules, resulting in inordinate traffic delays. This happens even when the junctions have signboards indicating a free left turn.</p><p class="body">Long queues of vehicles can be seen on Wayanad Road (National Highway 212) at the Malaparamba junction even during non-peak hours. Occasionally, the vehicular queue on the road leading to Vellimadukunnu extends to Paroppady and on the Eranhipalam side, till the IQRAA hospital.</p><p class="body">The intersection at the Malaparamba- Kozhikode bypass is so narrow that even two-wheelers cannot take the free left turn. Motorists proceeding straight towards Eranhipalam or deviating to the right, towards Pooladikunnu, block the free left turn at the junction when the traffic signal is red. As such, vehicles have to wait up to 90 seconds till the signal turns green and sometimes wait for a second turn, if they are at the end of the queue.</p><p class="body">Ambulances and fire fighters have a harrowing time crossing the junction to reach the Government Medical College, Kozhikode. Adding to the chaos is the vehicles taking a left turn from the Florican Road to Wayanad Road. Fortunately, the traffic police have restricted vehicles from taking a right turn from Wayanad Road to Florican Road and vice-versa.</p><p class="body"><b>Narrow stretches</b></p><p class="body">Similar is the case on the other side of the road at Malaparamba junction. Vehicles coming from Eranhipalam and going towards the Providence Women&#8217;s College or Pooladikunnu have to wait for a green signal. The temporary solution is to widen the road on both sides of the junction, thereby allowing vehicles easy movement of free left turn.</p><p class="body">Confusion prevails at Eranhipalam junction, a few km from Malaparamba. The traffic congestion is more severe as the free left turns at the intersection on Mini Bypass Road on both sides of the junction are narrow. This apart, the road tapers at the junction on the four-lane Arayadathupalam-Eranhipalam road.</p><p class="body">Vehicles have a smooth ride on the 2.9-km track from Arayadathupalam but those intending to take a left turn towards East Nadakkavu will have to wait till the signal turns green at Eranhipalam.</p><p class="body">Vehicles coming from the opposite side &#8212; Karaparamba side to Eranhipalam &#8212; face a similar situation. Autorickshaws and two-wheelers coming from the Karikkamkulam side usually take the alternative route from Karaparamba along the Canolly canal to Eranhipalam.</p><p class="body"><b>Land acquired</b></p><p class="body">More than a year ago, revenue officials hastily acquired land for widening the Karaparamba- Eranhipalam road. But till now no construction has begun. One of the reasons cited is the laying of pipes for the Japan-aided drinking water project and for sewerage network of the Kerala Sustainable Urban Development Project.

Sankar at Palayam in Thiruvananthapuram city in violation of its order prohibiting erection of statues on public roads and highways.</p><p class="body">A Bench of Justices S.J. Mukhopadaya and V.

Contending that by granting permission for erecting the statues in violation of the Supreme Court order dated January 13 and 18, the government had committed a contempt of court, K.R. Pradeep Kumar of Neyyattinkara has filed the petition.</p><p class="body">The petitioner pointed out that when the government proposed to install the statue of Sundaran Nadar, he approached the apex court and status quo was ordered.</p><p class="body">The court had made it clear to the State government that no construction should take place and imposed a total ban on all kinds of statues and structures in public places.</p><p class="body">Similarly, on coming to know of the erection of the two statues of Anne Mascarene and Sankar, he made a representation to the authorities to stop the installation but to no avail.

It was a win that surprised many. Set in 1866 in a small town on New Zealand&#8217;s South Island, the story begins when a traveller and gold prospector, Scotsman Walter Moody, interrupts a meeting of 12 men at Hokitika&#8217;s Crown Hotel. These men are immigrants but locals now who gather in secrecy to solve crimes. The novel is about the mystery surrounding the death of Crosbie Wells and the stories told by those 12 men. The narrative architecture is based around the 12 signs of the zodiac and the seven planets; each chapter is half the length of its predecessor, adding pace and tension. Of the books shortlisted &#8212; Jim Crace&#8217;s<i>Harvest</i>, Jhumpa Lahiri&#8217;s<i>The Lowland</i>, Ruth Ozeki&#8217;s<i>A Tale for the Time Being</i>, Colm Toibin&#8217;s<i>The Testament of Mary</i>, and Noviolet Bulawayo&#8217;s<i>We Need New Names</i>&#8212; it was widely assumed that the battle for the winning post would be between Jim Crace and Colm Toibin.</p><p class="body"><i>The Luminaries</i>is in the tradition of a good, well-told, 19th century English novel. It has a leisurely pace with the story slowly being told, bit by bit. Eleanor Catton has trained at the best creative writing schools and is an alumna of the prestigious University of Iowa Writers&#8217; Workshop. But this novel is an example of original thinking and excellent craftsmanship that is not easily taught.</p><p class="body">The chair of judges, Robert Macfarlane, described the book as a &#8220;dazzling work, luminous, vast.&#8221; It is, he said, &#8220;a book you sometimes feel lost in, fearing it to be &#8216;a big baggy monster&#8217;, but it turns out to be as tightly structured as an orrery.&#8221; It is true that the 19th century novels were inevitably serialised (for example Charles Dickens and Anthony Trollope) and then put together as a book. Present day writers are taking advantage of virtual publishing to do something similar.<i>The Kills</i>by Richard House, long listed for the Man Booker Prize 2013, actually began life as four enhanced e-books that were then published as a single printed volume. But in the 21st century, to first publish in print such a thick book as<i>The Luminaries</i>takes extraordinary courage &#8212; a fact that did not go unnoticed even by Catton. In her acceptance speech she said, &#8220;&#8230;<i>The Luminaries</i>is and was from the very beginning, a publisher&#8217;s nightmare. [&#8230;] I am extraordinarily fortunate to have found a home at these publishing houses and to [&#8230;] have managed to strike an elegant balance between making art and making money.&#8221;</p><p class="body"><b>For more entries</b></p><p class="body">At 28, Eleanor Catton is the youngest winner of the Booker. (Before this it was Ben Okri who won it when he was 32 for<i>The Famished Road</i>.) Catton was born in Canada and raised in Christchurch, New Zealand. The Booker is Britain&#8217;s most prestigious literary prize, awarded annually to a novelist from Britain, Ireland or a Commonwealth country. The winner receives £50,000, or about $80,000. The winner is selected by the judging panel on the day of the ceremony. In September 2013, it was announced that from next year the prize will be open to all those publishing in English, across the world, a move that has not necessarily been received well by many writers. Jonathan Taylor, chairman of the foundation, wrote at the time: &#8220;Paradoxically it has not [&#8230;] allowed full participation to all those writing literary fiction in English. It is rather as if the Chinese were excluded from the Olympic Games.&#8221;</p><p class="body">It is a fortunate coincidence that in 2013, three of the high-profile international awards for literature have been won by women &#8212; all for very distinct kinds of writing. Lydia Davis won the fifth Man Booker International Prize 2013 for her short stories (the length of her stories vary from two sentences to a maximum of two to three pages) and the Nobel Prize for Literature 2013 to Alice Munro, for her short stories and Eleanor Catton, Man Booker Prize 2013, for a novel that has been described as a &#8220;doorstopper.&#8221; For the world of publishing, these achievements seal the stamp of approval on craftsmanship. It is probably recognition of geographical boundaries disappearing in digital space, conversations happening in real time and emphasis being placed on good content. It's not the form but the craft that matters. Eleanor Catton&#8217;s Man Booker Prize win is a testament to the new world of publishing.</p><p class="body"><i>(Jaya Bhattacharji Rose is an international publishing consultant and columnist.

Krishnana, regional president (South Asia), Novozymes, this new technology will have a positive impact on India&#8217;s programme to introduce 20 per cent ethanol content in fuel by 2017. &#8220;India and its oil marketing companies (OMCs) have been watching these developments very closely and now they can make use of this new technological breakthrough to not only reduce the oil import bill, but also reduce the outgo of foreign exchange. It will take the technology to the next level and the OMCs have floated tenders to source ethanol,&#8217;&#8217; he added.</p><p class="body">Presently, Indian OMCs have been mandated to use five per cent ethanol in fuel which is proposed to be hiked to 20 per cent by 2017. However, the lack of proper and effective technology had impacted the progress of this mission..  </p><p class="body">The technology will turn agricultural waste into millions of litres of low-emission green fuel, proving that cellulosic ethanol is no longer a distant dream and is ready for large-scale commercialisation.</p><p class="body">&#8220;We will continue to commercially expand Beta Renewables&#8217; core technology throughout the world, and we are very confident at this stage given the demand we see around the globe,&#8221; Peder Holk Nielsen, CEO of Novozymes, said.</p><p class="body">Both Mossi Ghisolfi Group and Novozymes formed a strategic partnership in October last year, making Novozymes the preferred enzyme supplier for Beta Renewables&#8217; current and future cellulosic biofuel projects. The technology at the facility uses wheat straw, rice straw and arundo donax, a high-yielding energy crop grown on marginal land. Lignin, a polymer extracted from biomass during the ethanol production process, is used at an attached power plant, which generates enough power to meet the facility&#8217;s energy needs, with any excess green electricity sold to the local grid.</p><p class="body">&#8220;Policy makers all over the world now need to send clear signals to encourage the necessary investments in advanced biofuels,&#8217;&#8217; Mr. Nielsen said. Stable and predictable blending mandates, incentives for the collection of agricultural residues, and investment support for the first large-scale plants will help move the world substantially in terms of reducing greenhouse gasses, stimulating economies, and providing energy security. Continued reliance on fossil fuels is not viable.</p><p class="body">A recent study by Bloomberg New Energy Finance concludes that transforming agricultural residues into advanced biofuels could create millions of jobs worldwide, economic growth, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and energy security by 2030. Government support is, however, vital to accelerate the deployment of next-generation bio refineries. More than $200 million has been invested in research and development of the technology used to produce cellulosic ethanol at the Crescentino facility.</p><

This is a practice the Kalakshetra Colony Residents Association undertakes every year before the North East monsoon.</p><p class="body">The locality comprises six major roads, Rukmani Road, MGR Road, Beach Road, Arundale Beach Road, Appar Street and Mahalakshmi Avenue and a raft of smaller connecting roads. It has about 3,000 houses. Active participation from the residents has ensured that rainwater is not wasted and the area is protected from inundation.</p><p class="body"/><p class="body">&#8220;Last year, we completed the desilting work by January, spending approximately Rs.10,000,&#8221; says Shanthi Krishna, general secretary of the association.</p><p class="body">Constructing recharge wells for an apartment complex or independent house is a norm. Many localities don&#8217;t construct recharge wells for the roads. According to director of Rain Centre, Raghavan, the recharge wells are 10 feet deep, three feet in diameter and have 16 holes with a percolated lid. &#8220;For areas close to the coast, constructing storm water drains is not a solution to water stagnation,&#8221; he says. Following a slew of campaigns, the Corporation opened up to this idea and agreed to construct recharge wells at First Avenue, Besant Nagar (close to the terminus). &#8220;A total of 16 such wells, four feet deep were constructed,&#8221; he explains.</p><p class="body">Residents recall that much before the recharge wells were constructed, the area would be filled with puddles of water that would not percolate easily. &#8220;Since the wells were constructed in mid-2000, there has been no water stagnation. Our roads are like carpets,&#8221; says Ms. Krishna.</p><p class="body">However, increasing commercialisation is putting a damper on the initiative as some of the harvesting pits are getting closed. Otherwise, the colony has an effective mechanism whereby residents call the association members to clear debris that is blocking water from percolating into the wells.</p><

Lakshmi Prasad. The relatively slim chance of a major fire breaking out in a residential apartment, lack of space for an additional staircase in the existing buildings and reluctance of neighbouring building to allow a bridge, be put across as a means of escape, were some of the factors which led to the decision to do away with the extra stairs stipulation.</p><p class="body">Earlier, officials were mulling to allow a spiral staircase or a stairway equivalent to that of a fire service ladder. Mr. Prasad, however, was quick to point out that buildings having penthouses would still have to install minimum fire fighting equipment like for a five-storied structure, there should be a terrace tank of 25,000 litres, hose reel accessible to each floor, etc. </p><p class="body"><b>Fire precaution fee</b></p><p class="body">A non-refundable fire precaution fee of Rs. 10 per sq. metre of total built up area in all floors will have to be paid and it could be up to Rs. 3.5 lakh to make a five-storied building with a penthouse on top safe from fire mishaps and obtain the No Objection Certificate (NOC). </p><p class="body">There are close to 2,000 penthouses and 300-odd commercial complexes filed under BPS awaiting fire clearances. A NOC should be obtained for all residential buildings of 18 metres high or six floors and commercial buildings of 15 metres or five floors. Mr. Prasad says existing commercial buildings should be tackled on a case by case basis. Yet, there is a way out for buildings constructed in 500 sq. metres plot with open staircases and alleys. In place of an extra staircase they too could go for installation of fire safety equipment. But a hefty penal fee has to be shelled out to the fire services department to strengthen its fire fighting infrastructure. </p><p class="body">Commissioner Sameer Sharma is to take a final call on the issue as it could not only bring the much needed revenue but also relieve several citizens from the stigma of occupying illegal dwellings.</p><p class="body"><i><b>Rule may be done away with if buildings take certain &#8216;minimum acceptable fire safety measures' </b></i></p><

The reason was not difficult to fathom: traffic congestion on the road.</p><p class="body">In August 2012, the Corporation sources said that the civic body had identified a 11.17-acre plot in Vilankurichi, north of the Codissia Trade Fair Complex. The Corporation said that 8.44 acre of the 11.17-acre plot belonged to the Boodhan Board. The rest belonged to individuals, from whom it would acquire the land. On the 8.44-acre land it would establish the bus stand and use the rest for constructing an 80-feet approach road.</p><p class="body">While mooting the proposal the Corporation had also said that it planned to implement the proposal at the earliest as traffic congestion on the Sathyamangalam Road was getting worse by the day as the entry and exit of buses affected the movement of vehicles not only on the Sathyamangalam Road but also on the 100 Feet Road.</p><p class="body">The presence of the 100 Feet Road junction only compounded the problem.</p><p class="body">Consequent upon the decision, the Corporation sent a proposal to the district administration to forward a proposal to the Commissioner of Land Reforms as the land belonged to Boodhan Board.</p><p class="body">This was six months ago, the sources said and added that from then nothing much had changed.</p><p class="body"><b>Proposal</b></p><p class="body">Talking to journalists, Mayor S.M. Velusamy said that though the Corporation had mooted the proposal six months ago, nothing much had changed because the Revenue Department had not forwarded the proposal.

Along with the n number of television channels and the FM radio stations, there are also the video games, malls and multiplexes to keep the youth happy. Just about 25 years back, people had to look forward to the humble AIR and the Doordarshan which provided people not only entertainment but also information. All India Radio is the national broadcaster . It is certainly not an exaggeration to say that it is living up to the motto &#8211; Bahujan Hitaya, Bahujan Sukhaya (which means for promoting the welfare and happiness of the masses.)</p><p class="body">All India Radio is one of the largest broadcasting organisations in the world in terms of the number of languages of broadcast. It has 403 stations today across the country and is heard in almost 92 per cent of India. Isn&#8217;t mind-blowing to think that this radio is heard by almost 99.19 pe cent of the population???</p><p class="body"/><p class="body"><b>The beginning</b></p><p class="body">The first ever broadcast in the country was in June 1923, thanks to the Radio club of Bombay. The Calcutta Radio club was set up five months later. The Indian Broadcasting Company which was inaugurated in 1927 was closed even before it could celebrate the third anniversary. Under the Department of the Industries and labour, the Indian Broadcasting service was set up in 1930. Five years later, Akashvani Mysore was set up. What was referred to as Indian State Broadcasting service became All India Radio in 1936.</p><p class="body">After independence</p><p class="body">When India attained independence in 1947, AIR had just 6 stations &#8211; Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Tiruchi and Lucknow and only 11 per cent of the entire population was the audience. There were three stations in Pakistan &#8211; Peshawar, Lahore and Dacca. AIR is certainly an integral part of India&#8217;s rich history. It now covers 24 languages and 146 dialects. In the year 1956, the national broadcaster adopted the name Akashvani. The following year, Vividh Bharati service was launched where film music was its main component. The external services division broadcasts programmes in 11 Indian and 16 foreign languages in more than 100 countries. The News services division has 647 bulletins daily in about 90 languages. AIR FM Rainbow and AIR FM Gold are popular stations (in FM wave).</p><p class="body">The Government is leaving no stone unturned to make AIR completely digitalized.

Long term consequences of the reduced oxygen supply to the brain are higher incidence of diabetes mellitus, elevated blood pressure, heart attacks or strokes. Excessive daytime sleepiness can lead to higher incidence of traffic accidents, said Dr Ranjini.

But policy neglect in our cities is unsettling,&#8221; said Anumita Roychowdhury of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).</p><p class="body">She added that CSE head Sunita Narain was seriously injured in an accident while cycling on Sunday. Dr. Narain is now stable, according to the doctors at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Monday. She was hit at the foot of the clover leaf of the flyover near AIIMS.</p><p class="body">&#8220;This flyover promises the dream of speed and unbridled smooth run to motor vehicles through a signal-free corridor. Delhi is still desperate for more flyovers and misses the point already understood by other nations. When cities adopt grade separated intersections and signal-free corridors, it increases speed of all motorised vehicles &#8212; and accident risk. This is evident in the stark numbers from the recent analysis of the Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Programme at IIT-Delhi. This shows the probability of a pedestrian fatality in collision with different vehicle groups in such areas can increase between 67 per cent and 200 per cent,&#8221; noted Ms. Roychowdhury.</p><p class="body">She added it is ironical that the other road &#8212; Aurobindo Marg &#8212; that cuts across this flyover on Ring Road (where the accident took place), was recently reconverted at the instance of the Traffic Police from a signal-free corridor to a signalised corridor to calm traffic and reduce accidents.</p><p class="body">&#8220;As a signal-free corridor, it had become one of the 20 deadliest roads in Delhi until 2011. But after it was signalised, it became one of the safest. The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, of which Dr. Narain is a member, had supported this move.&#8221;</p><p class="body">The CSE also noted that cycling has been made difficult by design in this city despite more households owning bicycles than cars or two-wheelers.</p><p class="body">&#8220;Delhi has the highest number of cyclists. But most people cycle not out of choice, but because they cannot afford anything else. And those who could have cycled as a preferred mode of travel are afraid and shun the idea.&#8221;</p><p class="body">Noting that it was the &#8220;car priority&#8221; urban design and traffic management that surrenders public spaces and walkways to cars and parking, and cuts off direct access of walkers and cyclists, increases their detours, and takes away playgrounds from children, Ms. Roychowdhury said &#8220;this locks up enormous ill health in our society&#8221;.</p><p class="body">The CSE and other environmentalists have demanded that cities be designed for safety and access and actively discourage car-centric infrastructure.</p><p class="body">&#8220;Please do not be polite about your right to walk and cycle,&#8221; she said.</p><

Surendra Rao</p><p class="body">hose who watch Indian movies are frequently treated to melodramatic conflicts between two siblings taking opposite routes in life in which circumstances of their upbringing overrule the dictates of genetics. If we do not allow the force of the melodrama to overwhelm us, we can use this motif to shed light on the experience of the Indian subcontinent, where, following the freedom from the colonial rule, India opted for democracy while Pakistan kept stumbling into unstable autocracy. Though this phenomenon had drawn the attention of historians and political analysts earlier, Maya Tudor interrogates it with fresh confidence to situate it in the broader discourse of post-colonial democratisation.</p><p class="body">The differing trajectories of development in India and Pakistan have hitherto been variously explained as the result of differential colonial inheritance, economic growth or income inequality, varying religious and ethnic factors and even international influences. But Maya Tudor shows that their empirical bases and explanatory efficacy are weak and argues, instead that, first, the kinds of social classes leading each country&#8217;s independence movement and, second, the strength of the dominant political party at independence were the most important causes of India&#8217;s and Pakistan&#8217;s divergent democratic trajectories.</p><p class="body">Drawing on the Weberian definition of classes not as objective communities but as &#8220;merely represent (ing) possible, and frequent, bases for communal action&#8221;, the author validates Barrington Moore&#8217;s hypothesis &#8216;cautiously but conditionally&#8217; which stresses the importance of both a substantial commercialisation of middle class and a weakening landed aristocracy to the emergence of democratic regimes.</p><p class="body">She seeks to show that social classes with opposing interests in promoting democratic reform founded political movements in British India and that class attitudes toward democratic reform were directly responsible for the primary goals of independence movements in India and Pakistan.</p><p class="body">While the growing ranks of a new, educated, and urban middle class across colonial India established the Indian National Congress as a means of promoting its own upward mobility, it did so by advocating limited but clearly pro-democratic reforms. If the leaders of what was seen as &#8220;the germ of native parliament&#8221; initially preferred elite bargaining to mass politics, later developments nudged them, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, to popular, programmatic and pro-democratic nationalism. The Muslim League, on the other hand, began as an association of landed aristocracy which felt threatened by the demand for, and introduction of, the elective principle into colonial political institutions, so much so the ideology of the Muslim League in its early years &#8220;is better described as loyalist and anti-democratic than as pro-Muslim.&#8221;</p><p class="body">Whatever concession it got in the 1909 reforms was largely due to colonial patronage and the decision to over-represent Muslims was directly taken to countervail Congress&#8217;s growing influence. It paradoxically undermined any need for political mobilisation until the prospect of Indian independence loomed.</p><p class="body"><b>Gandhian leadership</b></p><p class="body">The dynamics of Indian freedom movement under the Gandhian leadership emanated from its ability and willingness to connect with disparate constituencies in a bid to develop a programmatic unity, so that by 1947 &#8220;Congress had helped delimit an Indian nation, establish its egalitarian character, and broadly popularise nationalism in the consciousness in a broad swath of colonial Indian society&#8230;&#8221; The Muslim League as the &#8216;institutional incarnation of Pakistani nationalism&#8217; was &#8220;anti-democratic in the sense that it rejected a defining process of democracy.&#8221; Its social and political alliances were weak, it had no economic programmes to project and was driven only by its anti-Hindu rhetoric and the Pied Piper charisma of Jinnah. If Congress was able to hammer out coherent coalitions with class groups with conflicting interests, the Muslim League merely cobbled together &#8220;a relatively incoherent distributive coalition&#8221; eschewing the need to build regional and local party organisations.</p><p class="body">In fact, the central contention of the book is that the relationship between distributive conflict on the one hand and regime stability on the other is mediated through the construction of robust political institutions, particularly, political parties. That explains the relative strength of the regime-founding coalitions in India and their brittleness in Pakistan.</p><p class="body"><b>Differences</b></p><p class="body">The democratic strength of Congress and the weak democratic impulses and practices of the Muslim League had a determining impact on the nature of political freedom and society which India and Pakistan established. While the making of the Indian Constitution or implementing it was rendered easy by the content and experience Indian national movement, the fragility of Pakistani national movement returned to haunt the new nation, to render it democratically unstable. It also suffered progressive loss of immunity to fitful civil autocracies and military dictatorships, argues Maya Tudor. As we sow, they say, so we reap.</p><p class="body">The jacket of the book carries two photographs: One, of the bare-headed Mahatma addressing a disparate but attentive crowd of khadi-clad women and men in the open, and the other of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, - imperious, cigarette between his lips and under a parasol held by a liveried servant, holding court. Together they offer a fine example of visual semiotics.</p><p class="body">The book itself is an eloquent exposition of the suggestive difference. Comparing the birth and trajectories of Indian and Pakistani nationalisms has its risks, suffused as they are with differences, conflicts and recriminations. But<i>The Promise of Power</i>promises an academic and analytical fare, and it has more than redeemed its promise.</p><p class="body"/><p class="body">(<i>B.

The town&#8217;s footpaths are narrow, crowded, encroached upon and, along most stretches, a no-go place for pedestrians.</p><p class="body">A stroll from the Statue Junction to Poornathrayeesa Temple, a distance of about 400 metres, is enough to discover the extent of the problem in a town marked by heavy traffic as it is the eastern entry and exit point for the Kochi urban area.</p><p class="body">The footpaths on the northern side of the road are inaccessible at most points with make-shift shops, arches welcoming shoppers to festival sales and parking of vehicles. The southern side of the road, where the footpath is narrower, too poses the same problem for pedestrians. Water logging too makes things difficult for pedestrians as was seen at the western end of the road, where access to footpath is almost impossible on the north side.</p><p class="body">Things are made more difficult with the road being extremely narrow and which sees heavy traffic of passenger buses because traffic coming from Ernakulam and going to the east use the route as they exit the bus stand.</p><p class="body">Footpaths on the west end of the road on both sides are damaged badly and a careless step can land a pedestrian in serious trouble. Another serious issue for pedestrians in the town is the low-hanging advertisement boards that obstruct visibility and pose a threat of physical injury. The advertisement boards, mostly flex, are hung or placed about the height of five to six feet. Most pedestrians prefer to step down from the footpath to avoid a collision with these advertisement boards.</p><

It had recently granted Rs. 168 crore for acquiring lands along the road, which runs from Padi to Thiruninravur. The Chief Minister in April had announced that the road would be made into a six lane facility.</p><p class="body">The two- lane road passes through Mannurpet, Korattur, Ambattur Industrial Estate, Ambattur OT, Thirumullavoyal, Sekkadu, Nadukuthagai and Nemilicheri and carries over 45,000 vehicles every day. Sources in the Highways Department, which has been maintaining the stretch after the National Highways Authority of India handed it over to the State, said that tenders were being scrutinised for widening the road into a four-lane facility. &#8220;We expect that work will commence soon. It will be completed in nine months. During this time, the land acquisition process would be taken up for making the road into a six-lane facility. Currently, the land plan schedule, which gives the requirement for the widening, is being prepared,&#8221; the source explained.</p><p class="body">There are hundreds of shops along the road and the shopkeepers had objected to the six-laning. However, residents have been clamouring for widening the narrow road that is accident prone.</p><p class="body">Pattabhiram resident T. Sadagopan said that shops selling spare parts and machine tools could perhaps be moved inside the Ambattur Industrial estate. &#8220;It would be a win-win situation for the shopkeepers and industrial units which use the tools,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="body">Many shops also encroach upon the road, thus denying pedestrians their space, said Korattur resident S.

Police officers said this was one of the first cases of women being molested in a bus in broad daylight to come up before the city police.</p><p class="body"><b>Students vulnerable</b></p><p class="body">However, women in the city said most cases of molestation in private buses went unreported. School girls and college students are especially vulnerable to being groped or pinched in a bus.</p><p class="body">&#8220;Many of my friends have had similar experiences. But they almost never react because they are afraid of how people around them will respond. Being molested is very traumatic and your courage will drain away and you are simply unable to react,&#8221; said a college student in the city. K.M. Sivaraman, principal of Government Girls&#8217; High School, Ernakulam, said he had received a few complaints from students about harassment in private buses. &#8220;We forwarded these to the police but nothing has come out of it. Harassment in private buses is more common than is reported,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="body"><b>Awareness camps</b></p><p class="body">Women&#8217;s Commission member Lissy Jose said the commission had been conducting awareness programmes in schools and colleges to encourage students to report and react to molestation. &#8220;Molesters are banking on the fact that most girls and women stay silent. These incidents can be curbed if a few people come forward to report such crimes,&#8221; she said.</p><

District Collector P.I. Sheikh Pareeth said the new conditions would be applicable for important roads of the Public Works Department (PWD). The PWD will be asked to draw up an annual plan for road works and communicate it to the departments concerned at the district road coordination committee.</p><p class="body">&#8220;Based on this plan, other departments will be given a window for carrying out work that involves digging up roads. Sanction will be given for such work only if the agencies concerned give an undertaking on a time limit for completing the work and deposit the estimated cost of road restoration,&#8221; Mr. Pareeth told<i>The Hindu</i>.</p><p class="body">Asked whether the agency concerned would be penalised if the work overshot the allotted period, the Collector said it would be decided by the coordination committee.</p><p class="body">Such a coordination committee chaired by the District Collector already exists, but has largely been reduced to a toothless arrangement. Though the committee is supposed to be informed about work involving digging up of roads by agencies such as the Kerala Water Authority or the BSNL, which are also expected to deposit restoration expenses, in many cases, the committee is hardly aware about such work.</p><p class="body">A senior official of the PWD admitted that while the committee should be informed about all works except in emergency cases such as pipe burst, there were many such instances in which it was not done. &#8220;In fact, in many cases, the PWD is in the dark and come to know of such instances only when poorly restored roads lead to accidents. There is nothing wrong in digging up roads to repair a burst pipe since it is an essential service, but the agency concerned should see to it that the road is properly restored,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="body"><b>&#8216;Flawed approach&#8217;</b></p><p class="body">D. Dhanuraj, chairman, Centre for Public Policy Research, said there was a fundamental flaw in treating infrastructure developments around a road in isolation.</p><p class="body">&#8220;The need of the hour is to develop a concept of the street and to entrust a single agency with everything from road to infrastructure developments in streets. A manual for street development along the lines of the road development manual should be drawn up and strictly adhered to while undertaking any work in the streets,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="body"><b>Lack of coordination</b></p><p class="body">Mr. Dhanuraj said the problem, at present, was that multiple agencies were engaged for various services and no amount of discussions among those agencies would help iron out some elements that were often overlooked.</p><p class="body">Consumer welfare activist Dejo Kappen of the Centre for Consumer Education said no new arrangements would help improve the condition of road as long as the lack of coordination among agencies persisted.</p><p class="body">The pathetic condition of Tripunithura-Aryankavu Road and the Piravom-Nadakkavu Road, which were dug up for pipeline works, best exemplified it, he said.</p><

By facilitating smooth passage for those travelling between Secunderabad and also from Khairatabad on one side and Balkampet and Fatehnagar on the other side, the stretch also cuts down the travel distance by around 3 km.</p><p class="body">The GHMC officials said the works on a road under bridge here has been completed by the South Central Railway and a bridge by the civic body has also been taken care of already. Some sheds that need to be removed were acquired recently and the work on moving them out and widening the stretch was on.</p><p class="body">&#8220;In fact, most of the link road is completed and ready. Few works such as sewage realignment and little cement patches are to be attended and the same are on,&#8221; said GHMC Engineer-in-Chief Dhan Singh. Once the sewer works were completed, a retaining wall has to be set up, all of which could be through in less than two months.</p><p class="body">A small patch of road though completed had not been carpeted and the officials said it would be taken up as part of the finishing touches in the last stage. &#8220;Very soon the stretch towards Balkampet from Begumpet will be brought to use and the other part of the project would be taken up later,&#8221; Mr. Singh said.</p><p class="body"><i><b><p class="body">GHMC took up the work on this project in 2005-06 at an estimated cost of Rs.45 crore</p></b></i></p><

Over the past decade or so, one point has become evident. First, strong constituencies for peace between both countries have emerged along the border regions, be they Rajasthan-Sind or the two Punjabs. The enthusiasm with which people responded to Confidence Building Measures (CBMs), such as the Munabao-Khokhrapar train service and bus services connecting Delhi and Lahore and Amritsar-Lahore, are a reiteration of this point. It is a different matter, of course, that logistics issues have prevented both these initiatives from being a success.</p><p class="body">While in the case of the Punjab, opening up trade at the Wagah-Attari route and setting up the Integrated Check Post have got businessmen on both sides of the Radcliffe Line interested, some logistics issues persist. There is also a desire to open the Hussainiwala (Ferozepur)-Ganda Singh route, which was active before the 1971 war. This will be relevant especially in the context of the potential for petroleum trade between both countries, since the Bhatinda oil refinery, inaugurated in April 2012 by the Indian Prime Minister, is only 100 km from Hussainiwala. With the politics of Punjab being dominated by the Malwa belt, and the current Deputy Chief Minister, Sukhbir Singh Badal, being an MLA from Ferozepur, support for opening up this route is only likely to increase. The leather industry, which contributes 5.4 per cent of overall export earnings, will also benefit from the same trade route as Kasur city, adjacent to Ganda Singh and 60 km from Lahore, is a hub of tanneries in Punjab.</p><p class="body"/><p class="body"><b>Makes business, political sense</b></p><p class="body">In Rajasthan-Sind, while the train service is chugging along, trade through the Munabao-Khokhrapar route is yet to open, though there is strong support for it. This route too could come in handy for petroleum trade, since gas has been discovered at Barmer.</p><p class="body">Opening up these two borders would make sense from the business point of view, and come in handy politically for a number of reasons. North India will benefit more through land trade<i>vis-à-vis</i>Pakistan.</p><p class="body">Currently, trade is only allowed through the Wagah-Attari land route; other road links are ignored. Barki road connecting Lahore-Patti, the Kasur-Firozpur roads at the Ganda Singh border, the Sahiwal/Pakpattan road link with Fazlika, Head Sulemanki and Multan borders, have the potential to enhance Punjab-to-Punjab trade manifold.</p><p class="body">In the Pakistan context, Ganda Singh strengthens the pro-trade constituency in Punjab. In fact recently a delegation from Indian Punjab met Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was enthusiastic about the idea. Apart from this, opening up the Raj-Sind border would assuage feelings in Sind, especially for those who believe Punjab will benefit from India-Pakistan trade while other States will be left behind.</p><p class="body">If one were to look from the Indian side, opening more routes is important since this will help create a stronger political consensus for better ties. While Punjab is already ruled by the Shiromani Akali Dal, an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Rajasthan too could get a BJP government in the aftermath of the December Assembly elections. In addition to this, by opening up the Rajasthan-Sind border, businessmen from neighbouring States such as Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat which are BJP-dominated would also benefit. Currently, traders from Madhya Pradesh have to go all the way to the Wagah route.</p><p class="body">Existing as well as new markets have the potential to achieve the highest targets. The existing market, worth $13 billion, comprises smuggling and personal baggage. Therefore, the legalisation of trade would help the government of Pakistan earn revenue in the form of import duties. The key to the economic success of a country is promoting regional trade. However, Pakistan&#8217;s regional trade is less than five per cent of the total. Millions of dollars can be earned if more trade routes are opened.</p><p class="body"><b>Land over sea</b></p><p class="body">A study carried out in 2006 estimated that over 80 per cent of firms are forced to trade through the Karachi-Mumbai sea route, even if they are located in the border station of Amritsar. Similarly, the Sind-Rajasthan border can connect Rajasthan and Gujarat with Sind, which has huge potential to enhance trade between both countries by the land route. The Munabao-Khokhrapar rail route can lessen the burden on the Karachi-Mumbai sea route, which is the most common, formal trade route between India and Pakistan. It will also save time and money as the sea route requires cargo ships to touch a third-country port before bringing in goods.</p><p class="body">The Pakistan Army, being a strong and influential stakeholder, can be brought into the loop as it has a vested interest in the economic structure. This way, India-Pakistan business and people-to-people contact may be enhanced, and stringent visa policies may get relaxed.</p><p class="body">(<i>Tridivesh Singh Maini is a New Delhi-based columnist, and Usman Shahid, a Lahore-based journalist and researcher.

Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday vowed to fight against the &#8216;corrupt activities' of Revenue Minister Dharmana Prasada Rao.</p><p class="body">Participating in the road show here, Mr. Naidu levelled serious charges of corruption against the Minister. He alleged that Mr. Prasada Rao had grabbed 2 acres of municipal land in the town. Besides, land was leased for granite mining to Rammanohar Naidu, son of the Minister, in violation of all rules and regulations, he alleged.</p><p class="body">&#8220;The Minister should surrender the land to the Municipality since it is the property of the people and have the mining lease cancelled to protect the interests of tribals. The Minister has built roads to the mining area with the funds allocated for National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Is it not looting the public money? Mr. Naidu said.</p><p class="body">The TDP leader's visit to Dammala Veedhi, fish market and other places evoked good response. Later, Mr. Chandrababu Naidu, party's senior leader K. Yerran Naidu and others visited Kannedara Hills and assured the tribals that the party would extend wholehearted support to their agitation till the lease was cancelled. They also interacted with farmers who lost their lands due to construction of Vamsadhara Phase II. </p><p class="body">Meanwhile Ministers Dharmana Prasada Rao, Vatti Vasanta Kumar and Saturcharla Vijayarama Raju said Mr. Naidu had no right to talk about corruption since his own family amassed properties in illegal manner. They strongly objected the corruption charges levelled by him and remarked that this showed Mr. Naidu's desperation in the wake of several electoral setbacks.</p><p class="body"/><

Just visit the narrow, sloping public road connecting the Orphanage Road with the Mukkom Bus Stand Road. It hosts the Thazhekode village office, the panchayat office, the Krishi Bhavan and the Kudumbasree CDS offices. The panchayat library and reading room, the press forum and local MLA P. Moinkutty&#8217;s camp office share space on this road.</p><p class="body">For all these offices, the view is the same. Dead fish. Unauthorised fish stalls have taken over the arterial road. Trucks supplying fish to the stalls block the street. Waste water from these vehicles flows onto the road. Come mid-day, when sales peak, the place reeks. Ice on which the fish is kept on the tables melts and forms puddles in the street. When the stalls are cleaned, water is swept into the public drain, already overflowing.</p><p class="body">Students use the road to reach schools run by the Mukkom Muslim Orphanage nearby, gingerly stepping over the puddles, covering their noses. Worshippers heading for the Thazhekode Juma Masjid meet with the same fate.</p><p class="body"><b>Warnings unheeded</b></p><p class="body">Warnings have proved useless. Health inspectors had warned the Mukkom panchayat of the risk to public health. They had asked the panchayat to put a stop to the stall keepers canvassing customers by putting tables on the road.</p><p class="body">An order by Justice M.N. Krishnan, Ombudsman to the Local Self-Governing Bodies, on January 10, 2012, to stop sales on the public road is openly flouted. &#8220;The Ombudsman had ordered the panchayat secretary to monitor whether the stalls are encroaching on the road or causing a public health risk by dumping waste in public spaces. It had instructed the local body to seek police assistance if the stall keepers resisted. But this order is openly violated. Ironically, it is being done right in front of the panchayat office,&#8221; K. Balakrishnan, a social activist based in Mukkom, said.</p><p class="body">Mukkom panchayat secretary A.P. Sanal Kumar explains why the local body is helpless. &#8220;The land opposite the stalls was once the fish market. Battle lines were drawn between the fish sellers and the panchayat five years ago when we evicted them to build a double-storey building. They were promised alternative space. But none was given,&#8221; Mr. Kumar said candidly.</p><p class="body">So, the fish sellers rented space in the opposite building. When the panchayat issued eviction notice, the stall keepers approached the Kerala High Court saying that the local body did not fulfil its promise of an alternative space for them. The court stayed the eviction. Since then, the panchayat maintains a studied silence.</p><p class="body">&#8220;Whatever it is that is playing between those two (panchayat and fish sellers)&#8230; it is the public who is suffering. This is a public health issue and the panchayat has to take responsibility,&#8221; Salam Nedukandy, an environment activist, said.</p><p class="body">But Mr. Kumar says the stall keepers have been cool to the panchayat&#8217;s offers to find another spot. &#8220;We had earlier located a private land behind the old bus stand, a few kilometres away. A private party even set up 14 tables for them. But the shopkeepers refused to move,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="body">Besides, the fund to buy alternative land for the fish market is far from sufficient. It is just Rs.10 lakh. The panchayat needs at least 20 cents to house the market in an accessible place within the town. The fair value price per cent in Mukkom is Rs.4.5 lakh. &#8220;It is a deadlock. We cannot do much with just Rs.10 lakh. The panchayat has no authorised market,&#8221; Mr. Kumar admits.</p><p class="body">V. Abdulla Koya, president of Pothujana Vedi Samithi, said the forum had filed a complaint against the stalls with the Chief Minister&#8217;s mass contact programme. &#8220;Not one shop in that street is licensed. We tell people not to buy fish from there. It is not safe. But the stall keepers respond by selling it Rs.5 less. People flock to them. So much for protests,&#8221; Mr. Koya said.</p><p class="body">&#8220;I live behind the stalls. There are large waste-filled holes there. Many of my neighbours have sold their land. Nobody wants to take responsibility,&#8221; he said.</p><

(BMRCL), which has proposed a line on the same road. This was the suggestion of most citizens, who attended the public hearing on the road-widening project here on Saturday.</p><p class="body">The citizens opined that the road-widening can be scientific and comprehensive only if both projects are taken up simultaneously.</p><p class="body">The Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has proposed to widen the 7.5-km stretch between Jedi Mara and Chicken Farm on NICE Road to 45 metres. The road now has a width ranging between 22 m and 28 m. As many as 405 private properties will have to be acquired for the project, including 272 buildings, 122 empty sites and 11 temples. The BBMP has proposed to acquire the properties through TDR (Transfer of Development Rights).</p><p class="body">Even as Mayor B.S. Sathyanarayana appealed to the people to submit their consent letters for the process of road-widening soon to facilitate early start of the work, city in-charge Minister Ramalinga Reddy said the government would take a final call based on popular public opinion. He said the widening has been proposed based on a scientific survey. &#8220;The stretch should have been widened around a decade ago. There is a need to widen both Sarjapur Road and Bannerghatta Road,&#8221; he said. M. Desai from Meenakshi Layout Residents&#8217; Welfare Association said at least the metro pillar construction should be taken up along with road-widening. Concurring, Yogesh Devaraj from Bannerghatta Neighbourhood Trust said the BBMP must co-ordinate with the BMRCL, while Praveen Patel suggested that Bannerghatta Road be widened from Hosur Road junction itself.</p><p class="body"><b>Mixed views</b></p><p class="body">There were some mixed opinions at the public hearing. While a section favoured the widening and claimed that it would help decongest the busy road, there were some dissenting voices as well. Those opposed to the project claimed that the widening was unnecessary and junction improvements would solve traffic problems.</p><p class="body">Rajashekhar from Save Bangalore Committee said that the association was opposed to all road-widening projects. &#8220;Road-widening will only provide temporary relief. Make junctions signal-free and provide better pedestrian facilities instead,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="body">Ravi Kumar from Arakere Gate said the project would hit small property owners hard. He suggested the BBMP develop an alternative road network, promote car pooling and improve public transport. The BBMP should not take up the project to favour the big builders, he said.</p><p class="body">Many residents, especially those from Bilekahalli and Deverachikkanahalli, also demanded cash compensation instead of TDR. There were a few residents who demanded the TDR rate to be increased.</p><p class="body">Bangalore South MLA M. Krishnappa urged the BBMP to consider widening the road till the zoo. Bommanahalli MLA Satish Reddy maintained that road-widening was not to favour builders. He urged people to cooperate with the BBMP&#8217;s plans to widen the road and suggested that citizens regularising violations under Akrama Sakrama must be made to compulsorily buy TDR.</p><p class="body"/><
